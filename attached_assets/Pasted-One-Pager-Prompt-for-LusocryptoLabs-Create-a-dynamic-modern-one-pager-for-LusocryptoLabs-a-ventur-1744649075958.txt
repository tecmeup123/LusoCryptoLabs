Overview  
Who We Are: LusocryptoLabs is a team of three passionate innovators building tools and activities to advance the Nervos Network.  
Mission: Drive adoption and growth of the Nervos ecosystem through decentralized applications (dApps) and community-focused initiatives.  
Vision: Empower users with accessible, cutting-edge solutions that showcase the power of Nervos Network.
Our Products  
Token Minter dApp  
An upcoming dApp enabling users to mint custom tokens on Nervos Network.

Highlight its role as a foundational tool for token creation.
Gamified Community Bot  
A recently launched bot in the Telmo Talks community, rewarding user interactions with points.  
Points are redeemable for native Nervos tokens in the future.  
Emphasize its gamification approach to boost engagement and its active status.
DOB Minter  
A forthcoming dApp for minting Digital Objects (DOBs), Nervos’ advanced alternative to NFTs.  
Note its status as in development and its potential to redefine digital assets.

Design Requirements  
Style: Modern, sleek, with bold colors inspired by Web3 aesthetics (e.g., gradients, neons, or minimalist dark themes).  
Layout: Clear sections for Overview, Products, and Roadmap. Use icons or visuals to break up text.  
Roadmap Visual: Include a timeline graphic to illustrate key milestones, marking completed and upcoming stages.  
Call to Action: Ensure the Token Minter link is a clickable, standout button (with a note to activate post-launch if not yet live).
The one-pager should feel exciting and forward-looking, reflecting LusocryptoLabs’ role as a trailblazer in the Nervos Network ecosystem, with emphasis on our active bot and imminent product launches.
