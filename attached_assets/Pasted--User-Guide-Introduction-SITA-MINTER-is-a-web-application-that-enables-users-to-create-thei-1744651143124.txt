## Creating Your Token

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner
2. A JoyID popup will appear requesting connection
3. Approve the connection in JoyID
4. Once connected, your wallet address will display with a green checkmark

### Step 2: Configure Your Token

Fill in the following information in the token creation form:

1. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your token (e.g., "My Bitcoin Token")
    - Must be less than 64 characters
2. **Symbol**: Create a short identifier for your token (e.g., "MBT")
    - Must be 1-8 uppercase alphanumeric characters
    - Common practice is 3-4 letters
3. **Amount**: Specify the total supply of tokens to create
    - Enter a positive number (the system will confirm by spelling it out)
4. **Decimals**: Set the divisibility of your token
    - Between 0-18 (8 is standard for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin)
    - Example: 2 decimals means 0.01 is the smallest amount

### Step 3: Creator Tip Option

- Toggle "Tip Creator with Tokens" if you wish to allocate a percentage of tokens to the platform creator
- Use the slider to select the percentage (1-25%)
- The system will automatically calculate and display your kept tokens vs. tipped tokens

### Step 4: Create Your Token

1. Ensure you have at least 500 CKB in your connected wallet
2. Click the "Create Token with One Click" button
3. The platform will process your request through multiple steps:
    - Processing platform fee (300 CKB)
    - Creating seal transaction
    - Creating lock transaction
    - Finalizing token creation
    - Processing creator tip (if selected)

### Step 5: Sign Transactions

1. Multiple JoyID popups will appear sequentially for signing
2. You must sign 4-5 transactions in total:
    - Platform fee transaction
    - Seal transaction
    - Lock transaction
    - Token issuance transaction
    - Creator tip transaction (if selected)
3. Each transaction requires confirmation in your JoyID wallet
4. Make sure popup blockers are disabled in your browser

## Transaction Costs

### Basic Costs

- **Platform Support Fee**: 300 CKB (helps maintain the platform)
- **Network Fees**: Minimal
- **Total Basic Cost**: ~300 CKB

### Additional Costs (Optional)

- **Creator Tip Cell**: Additional CKB if you choose to tip the creator

## Token Management

Once your token is created, it will be available in your wallet. The token follows the RGB++ standard on Nervos CKB blockchain, which means:

1. You can transfer it to other addresses
2. The token has the properties you specified (name, symbol, supply, decimals)
3. The token exists as a live cell on the blockchain, verifiable via block explorers
